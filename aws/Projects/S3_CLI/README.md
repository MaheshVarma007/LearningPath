# S3 CLI Application

## Overview

The S3 CLI Application is a command-line tool designed to interact with Amazon S3 buckets. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing common S3 operations such as uploading, downloading, listing, and deleting files. The application is built in Python and is structured for easy extension and maintenance.

---

## Features

- **Upload files to S3 buckets**
- **Download files from S3 buckets**
- **List files and folders in a bucket**
- **Delete files from S3 buckets**
- **Configurable AWS credentials and region**
- **Extensible architecture for adding new commands**

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- AWS account and S3 access
- AWS credentials configured (via environment variables, AWS CLI, or config file)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd S3_CLI
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

Run the CLI application from the command line:

```sh
python -m s3_cli
```

Or, if you want to run the main entry point directly:

```sh
python src/s3_cli/__main__.py
```

You will see:
```
Starting S3 CLI application...
... (application output) ...
S3 CLI application finished running.
```

---

## Configuration

The application uses AWS credentials from your environment. You can set them up using the AWS CLI:

```sh
aws configure
```

Or set the following environment variables:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`
